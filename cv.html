                    <p>I've been more interested in game development and Roblox is one of the easiest platforms to start on. I've been hired by a small team and have been their Lead Programmer managing and developing the backend of their Games. StellarNet is one of them, its a Space-Tycoon type game where your goal is to raise the population on a variety of planets available. Right now the game isn't really ready for a release and is only released as an extremely early version of it.</p>

                    <h3>Roblox Anti-Cheat (TAC)</h3>
                    <p>In recent years, I've taken a break from modifying games and focused more on the opposite side : defending against cheats. I've attemped some Unity anticheats but they weren't that interesting as It had to be different for each game, so I've been focusing on Roblox Development and I made this lightweight anticheat which is effective against popular exploits. It's been used in some games and has proven effective. The anticheat is mostly based on server-side checks so circumventing it is extremely difficult.</p>
